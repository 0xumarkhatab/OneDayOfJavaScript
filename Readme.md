# OneDayOfJavaScript

Trying to Learn Deep Level JavaScript in one Day to develop smart contracts

I Know about React to some intermediate Level but i'm not an expert on Java script as "A standalone console based language"

This repo is the place of Transitioning from Basic Level Javascript to At least Intermediate Level Javascript.

Depicting Everything i learn in one Day !

Javascript is a baby subset of TypeScript

JavaScript has two types:

- Stand Alone Language like C++ (console based)
- DOM manipulation
  Today is the day about Stand Alone Javascript
  yeyyyyy....
  Let's Go

Inside HTMl , if you wanna write the code ,write it inside `<head>` or `<body>` sections.

##### Javascript Functions

    - Blocks of code
    - specific task oriented

###### syntax

<code> function function_name(List_Of_Paramters)
{

     //   work here
    }

i.e
function printMessage(element) {
console.log(element);
}

</code>
 The function is called by it's name with parameters passed 
There is no need explicitly state the 
 type of parameters  but in typescript,you do

##### Javascript Output

        *Document.write()
        * console.log()
        * Targetting HTML Elements
        * window.alert()
        * window.print()
        * alert()
        the parenthesis contains the data to be displayed

###### Javascript Variables

       start  with "let" keyword and write the name of the variable separated by space.
       i.e

<code>   
<pre>    
          let name ="Umar";
          let age=12;
          let isMale = true;
          let cgpa = 3.118;
</pre>
</code>

###### separate statements with semiColon (;)
