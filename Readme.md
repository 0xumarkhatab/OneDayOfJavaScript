# OneDayOfJavaScript

Trying to Learn Deep Level JavaScript in one Day to develop smart contracts

I Know about React to some intermediate Level but i'm not an expert on Java script as "A standalone console based language"

This repo is the place of Transitioning from Basic Level Javascript to At least Intermediate Level Javascript.

Depicting Everything i learn in one Day !

Javascript is a baby subset of TypeScript

JavaScript has two types:

- Stand Alone Language like C++ (console based)
- DOM manipulation
  Today is the day about Stand Alone Javascript
  yeyyyyy....
  Let's Go

Inside HTMl , if you wanna write the code ,write it inside `<head>` or `<body>` sections.

##### Javascript Functions

    - Blocks of code
    - specific task oriented

###### syntax

<code> function function_name(List_Of_Paramters)
{

     //   work here
    }

i.e
function printMessage(element) {
console.log(element);
}

</code>
 The function is called by it's name with parameters passed 
There is no need explicitly state the 
 type of parameters  but in typescript,you do

##### Javascript Output

        *Document.write()
        * console.log()
        * Targetting HTML Elements
        * window.alert()
        * window.print()
        * alert()
        the parenthesis contains the data to be displayed

###### Javascript Variables

       start  with "let" or "const" keyword and write the name of the variable separated by space.
       i.e

<code>   
Following are some data types
<pre>    
          let name ="Umar"; //string
          const age=12; //integer
          let isMale = true; //boolean
          let cgpa = 3.118; //float point numbers
          let salary = undefined; //undefined
          const obj = {
             Name:"Umar",
             Age:20,
          }
</pre>
</code>

**const** does not let the user to re assign the value to variable declared with it.

**let** alows the value change

###### separate statements with semiColon (;)

##### Javascript Reserved Words

=> You can not use reserved words or keyWords for naming variables or functions because it will clash on compile runtime.

- **Keyword** **Description**
- **var** Declares a variable
- **let** Declares a block variable
- **const** Declares a block constant
- **if** Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
- **switch** Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
- **for** Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
- **function** Declares a function
- **return** Exits a function
- **try** Implements error handling to a block of statements

###### Javascript Operators

      - Basic Operators +,-,/,*

<code>
let a=12;
let b=3;
let c = a*b;
let d = a/b;
</code>

###### Javascript Comments

      - string,starting with double slashes("//")
      - ignored by compiler

###### Javascript Case

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity. are some examples.


Learned some advanced some stuff too but didn't Find
The Time to write here !
But with that set , it's the Time to call the day off!
I'm Gonna sleep to get ready for tomorrow's Clarity Hackathon!
See ya people !
Signing off!
